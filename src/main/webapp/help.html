<p>Jenkins understands analysis reports of the following duplicate code detection tools:
   <ul>
    <li><a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html">PMD's Copy Paste Detector (CPD)</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.harukizaemon.com/simian/">Simian</a></li>
  </ul>
When this option is configured Jenkins shows the analysis results in different
views: historical result trend, module and package statistics, web UI
for viewing analysis reports and warnings, and so on.</p>
<p>You need to set up your build to run the duplicate code checker in order to use
this feature - this Jenkins plug-in does not perform the actual analysis!
This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called for
stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
